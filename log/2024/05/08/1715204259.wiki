I asked //AC// the question:

― Do you have an opinion of why most crypto people are more likely to trust a web-browser extension rather than a mobile app?

The response from //AC// was:

― DeFi apps require a higher level of attention than payment apps do. 
―  
― Take a bank app or payment app as an example. 
― I use Venmo to send money. 
― I use the BOA app to send money. 
― I use my mobile MM to send USDC (a form of money). 
―  
― They all do 1 thing, send money. I can be distracted and it'll be ok. 
―  
― BUT if I'm aping into a 5,000% APY farm that'll last a couple hours. Or I'm working with larger amounts. There's a certain level of due dilligence that I do in that moment: 
― - I manually look for SC addresses 
― - I check if they're verified on Etherscan 
― - I google the team members, if they're legit or some anons 
― - I check their Discord, TG for rug signals 
―  
― You can't do all that on the phone, I mean you could but its easier if you have TG, discord, chrome all open at the same time 
―  
― ❦ 
―  
― Then there's accounting, I typically use a spreadsheet or my system calculator to calculate the APR and determine ROI. I also need to record all that for tax reasons. 
―  
― TLDR, investing in DeFi is an active effort, more active than applying for a traditional bank loan.
