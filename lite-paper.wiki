§ Lite-Paper

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

A **lite-paper**, also written as **litepaper**, can be thought of a shorter version of a [[white-paper]].

Typically a **lite-paper** is written //before// the [[white-paper]] is written, and can be thought of //preview// or a //teaser// of the [[white-paper]]. 

In practice, many who plan to write a [[white-paper]] first write a **lite-paper**, and then expand the **lite-paper** into the [[white-paper]].

**Lite-Papers** were popularized among [[dapp]]s.

§§ Sections

There are many different ways one could structure a **lite-paper**, but — one way a **lite-paper** can be structured is:

• overview
• motivation
• mechanism
• implementation (also sometimes called "design" or "technology stack")
• conclusion

§§§ Mechanism versus Implementation

With a [[de-fi]] **lite-paper**, the //mechanism// is more about:

• economics mechanism design,
• mathematics,
• parameter definitions,
• formula definitions,
• sampling,
• may show how different choices for parameters lead to different results,
• financial engineering,
• etc.

With a [[de-fi]] **lite-paper**, the //implmentation// is more about:

• talk about ERC-??? interface(s) used.
• programming-language choices and possible code,
• etc.

Often, in the //implmentation// section, the author tries to //not reveal too much// so that others won't copy them before they get to market.
