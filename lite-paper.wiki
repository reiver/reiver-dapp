§ Lite-Paper

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

A **lite-paper**, also written as **litepaper**, can be thought of a shorter version of a [[white-paper]].

Typically a **lite-paper** is written //before// the [[white-paper]] is written, and can be thought of //preview// or a //teaser// of the [[white-paper]]. 

In practice, many who plan to write a [[white-paper]] first write a **lite-paper**, and then expand the **lite-paper** into the [[white-paper]].

§§ Sections

There are many different ways one could structure a **lite-paper**, but — one way a **lite-paper** can be structured is:

• overview
• motivation
• mechanism
• design
• conclusion
